### What I learned

During my work on this project my knowledge of HTML/CSS grew by leaps and bounds.  When becoming a web developer practice is far more useful tool than simply studying the material from a course.   Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

Although I learned a tremendous amount in creating the desktop version of this project, I still have to work on formatting issues to make sites more mobile responsive.  This is especially true of the iOS platform.  I suspect they seem to require additional markup language in order to render websites optimized for their devices more accurately.

Additionally, I still need to refine my understanding of CSS concepts such as parent and inherited elements.  I was really stuck in nailing these concepts down and can use this experience to know in the future what I need to work on in my studies.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
